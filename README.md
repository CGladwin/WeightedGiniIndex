![](GINI.png)

Short code to implement this formula (found in "Introduction to Data Mining 2nd Edition" by Pang-Ning Tan et al.), extended to calculate the weighted average GINI with multiple classes.

Where _p<sub>i</sub>(t)_ is the relative frequency of training instances that belong to class _i_ at node _t_, and _c_ is the total number of classes.
